Hi! I'm **Junhao Hu**, an aspiring PhD student interested in **distributed systems** and **databases**.

I enjoy thinking about how to:
- design and build **reliable, fault-tolerant distributed systems**, and  
- build **data-intensive services** that are scalable, observable, and easy to operate.

My current interests include:
- consensus and replication protocols for strongly consistent systems  
- storage and index structures for high-throughput workloads  
- practical tooling for debugging and benchmarking distributed systems  

This website has three main sections:

- **[Learning Path](/learning-path/):** how I learned distributed systems and databases, and the resources I found helpful.  
- **[Paper Notes](/paper-notes/):** my reading notes and commentary on research papers in distributed systems and data management.  
- **[Competitions](/competitions/):** write-ups of contests, projects, and benchmark challenges I participated in.

You can find my CV [here](/cv/).
